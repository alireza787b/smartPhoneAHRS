# smartPhoneAHRS
Attitude and Horizon Reference System (AHRS) application using Onboard smartphone Sensors
Linear Kalman Attitude Estimation (AHRS) 
Using Onboard Smart Phone IMU Version 1


Using this Simulink Model you can use your smartphone sensors to get raw gyroscope, accelrometer, magnetometer data and estimate the real-time attitude of the phone using Kalman filter. Pitch, Roll, Heading angles and rates.

This project is still in the development phase so use it at your own risk.
No noise filtering is done on the output. You can implement different noise reduction algorithms acccording to you application.

Because I dont have an Apple development ID, I only uploadded the Android version. But you can easily just change the sensor inputs the iOs version from Simulink support Package for iOS device.


You need to have following items for building this project.
MATLAB 2018 or later
Simulink support package for Android Device (or iOs if you wish)
Android Device equiped with Accelereometer , MAgnetometer, Gyroscope (IMU)


A complete Youtube tutorial is availabe for this project in the following Link:




If you added a feature to this model, or fixed a bug please commit to this git project or send it to me.
I will update this project with better features in near future.

Let me know if you have a simillar projet or need help
